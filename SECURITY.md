# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project is a collection of personal writeups for educational purposes. As such, it does not have "versions" in the traditional sense. The security of the underlying labs is the responsibility of PortSwigger.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

I take security very seriously. While this repository itself is unlikely to contain vulnerabilities, I welcome responsible disclosure for any of my future projects.

If you discover a security vulnerability in one of my projects, please report it to me privately. Do not create a public GitHub issue.

Please send an email to: [your-email@example.com]

I will do my best to respond to your report within 48 hours.

### What to Include in Your Report
*   A clear description of the vulnerability.
*   Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
*   Any proof-of-concept code or screenshots.

Thank you for helping to keep my projects secure. I believe in working with the security community to create a safer online environment.
