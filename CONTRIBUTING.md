# Contributing to My Web Security Journey

Thank you for your interest in my project!

At this time, this repository serves as my personal learning journal for the PortSwigger Web Security Academy labs. As such, I am not actively seeking code contributions or pull requests.

## Suggestions and Feedback

However, I am always open to learning and improving. If you have suggestions, feedback, or notice an error in one of my writeups, please feel free to open an issue in the repository. I appreciate any insights that can help me grow as a security professional.

## Reporting Security Issues

Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues. Refer to my SECURITY.md file for instructions on how to report them privately.

Thank you for your understanding.
